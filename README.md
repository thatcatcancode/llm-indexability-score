# LLM Indexability Score ðŸ¤–ðŸ¦¾

This is a simple tool for measuring how visible a web page is to an AI/LLM bot. This is different from a traditional SEO crawler, like Googlebot, which runs a headless browser and executes JavaScript. LLM bots only read server-rendered HTML and move on quickly to other web sites.
